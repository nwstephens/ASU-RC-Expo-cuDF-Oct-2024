# Accelerating Pandas and Polars with Zero Code Change using RAPIDS cuDF

### Presented at

[ASU Research Computing Expo 2024](https://na.eventscloud.com/ereg/newreg.php?eventid=812167&)

### Description

RAPIDS cuDF enables Pandas and Polars users to accelerate their existing workflows and third-party code with zero code change required. You can continue using Python code on CPUs for small-scale local development and testing, and then enable "accelerator mode" to run on GPUs when you want better performance.
